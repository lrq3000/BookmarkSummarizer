# TODO

* [ ] Finish implementing recommendations in docs/memory_test_report.md (for the moment we implemented 1. Fix content deduplication logic, 2. Resolve recursion errors in flush operations, 3. Implement comprehensive error handling).
* [ ] Easy multi platforms installers (maybe via pyInstaller?) to easy install for non Python developers.
